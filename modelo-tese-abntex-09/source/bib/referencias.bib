	Abstract = {Zebra is a free, fast, friendly information management system. It can index records in XML/SGML, MARC, e-mail archives and many other formats, and quickly find them using a combination of boolean searching and relevance ranking. Search-and-retrieve applications can be written using APIs in a wide variety of languages, communicating with the Zebra server using industry-standard information-retrieval protocols.
This manual explains how to build and install Zebra, configure it appropriately for your application, add data and set up a running information service. It describes version 1.3.28 of Zebra.},

	Abstract = {zetoc is a current awareness service for UK Higher and Further Education providing Z39.50 access to the British Library's Electronic Table of Contents database of journal articles and conference papers. The zetoc database, updated daily, may also be searched via a World Wide Web interface. An alerting service provides tables of contents by email for new journal issues when they are loaded. The current version of zetoc is Z39.50 Bath Profile compliant and can provide Dublin Core records encoded in XML in answer to Z39.50 search requests. An enhanced version of zetoc, currently a prototype under development, will hold the data within an XML repository, using Dublin Core as the basis of the metadata schema. This paper describes the encoding of bibliographic records for journal articles and conference papers in Dublin Core, and the interoperability between Dublin Core and other bibliographic standards. Keywords: Dublin Core, bibliographic citations, metadata standards, current awareness.},
